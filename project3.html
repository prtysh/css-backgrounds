                        <p><em>COLIN FRANK</em></p>
                        <p>Originally from Ottawa (CAN), Colin Frank experiments with sound, electronics, theatre,
                            installation
                            art, and percussion; investigating excess, bodily extremes, barely controllable instruments,
                            and
                            rich raw noises. His PhD research at the University of Huddersfield (UK) considers
                            unconventional
                            instruments and objects as active agents in the creative process. His duo Brutalust explores
                            intermedia performance to engage audiences in novel ways, and his group the Drift Ensemble
                            mixes
                            experimental improvisation with contemporary composition.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Active on international stages, he has most notably performed in the Huddersfield
                            Contemporary

                            and the Oorsprong curators series (NL). His instrumental compositions have been presented by

                            performance,
                            virtuosity, and beauty were explored in a collaborative environment. In his installation
                            works,
                            audiences are encouraged to interact with common objects, and his concern about plastic
                            waste
                            has
                            prompted critical commentary on consumptive habits.</p>
                        <p>Colin received a double-degree B.Mus in composition and performance from McGill University.

                        <p>An Irish multimedia artist practicing in Leicester, England. She is interested in virtual and
                            concrete space with the complexity of hindrance and negotiation within a space that affects
                            an
                            artistic practice. With influences from Constructivism, Dadaism, the contextual readings of
                            &lsquo;The Poetics of space&rsquo; (Gaston bachelor 1994) and &lsquo;The Production of

                        <p>Kerr&rsquo;s work is influenced by her actions of making, constructing and realisation of
                            artwork
                            in
                            a studio or showing space. Collage is the foundation of her ideas that she works back into
                            the
                            space, which then develops into installation or film or both combined, when combined these 2
                            approaches create a dialogue with many questions that also creates an engagement/vocal point
                            for
                            the
                            viewer.</p>

                        <p>We are continually in a process of learning. Practices and knowledge emerge and transform as
                            we make
                            our way through life. In this project, we focused on developing our understanding of the
                            spaces
                            around us. To reimagine and learn about those spaces, we experimented, dreamed, tested, and
                            made.
                            This playing with space - those of our physical homes, the Internet-space, and spaces of
                            technology
                            - meant we could change our attention. We could refocus our gaze on peculiarities, and
                            imagine new
                            possibilities for those spaces. The resulting artwork presents contradictions and
                            compliments within
                            a space and between multiple spaces. It transforms the available viewing space, turning a
                            particular
                            space into a new surrounding. These spatial augmentations changed our understanding of
                            spaces, and
                            allowed us to develop practices previously unbeknownst to us.</p>

                        <p>Sinead: creating art for her is quite physical through the practice of art, space and object.
                            While
                            location is important it&rsquo;s also working with spatial awareness and artistic intuition.
                            Coming
                            up with a concept is just something that comes with inspiration and bouncing words and ideas
                            off
                            each other. But bringing the ideas to life through technology is a challenge that she faces
                            during
                            the process. The art of communication is key; keeping in contact a must. Something that has
                            come up
                            throughout this residency is that &lsquo;you communicate what you visualise, while your
                            collaborator
                            might hear what you say, they don't fully see what you mean&rsquo;. The result can therefore
                            be
                            unexpected. Saying this, throughout this residency the collaborative process has been
                            portrayed
                            through conversations and sharing work which has been a breath of fresh air. Working in a
                            completely
                            different way previous to covid-19 has given a new perspective on the process for her. Using
                            new
                            softwares like sketchup, blender and colour director is new to her. She wanted to challenge
                            herself
                            to further her capabilities, and push the boundaries on what could be achieved in this
                            residency.
                            They both used techniques that brought this collaboration to life, such as green screening,
                            matte
                            generation and keying. These tools allowed them to have each other&rsquo;s spaces together,
                            to form
                            a new hybrid space, and create a new environment that does not exist.</p>

                        <p>Colin: The residency has been an interesting experiment in long-distance collaboration
                            cross-discipline, and, especially due to the April/May UK lockdown restrictions under which
                            this
                            residency occured, the limitation on space and movement has influenced my approach. Through
                            discussions with Sinead about disorientating space, mixing locations, and creating
                            alternative
                            perspectives on the direct surroundings one finds themself in, I began reimagining my own
                            house.
                            Through experimenting with the video camera &mdash; indeed, considering it as a performative
                            tool
                            &mdash; I explored the little noticed, disregarded alcoves around me. As they collected
                            images,
                            performances, and footage, gradually I found myself constructing a strange living space.
                            Partly my
                            house, partly Sinead&rsquo;s, an unreal connection formed in Internet-space. This, to me,
                            epitomizes
                            the residency: all the discussions on Zoom, performance videos being compiled in a shared
                            folder,
                            and their WhatsApp chat about art &mdash; these facets formed a place unto itself. A sort of
                            Internet hyperreal space emerged, much like the art they are working on, where creativeness,
                            exploration, contemplation, and inquisitiveness could coexist.</p>

                        <p><strong>In search of familiarity: A manufactured perception</strong></p>
                        <p>How can we reimagine the spaces we live in, especially when the confines of quarantine force
                            us to be
                            in them for above average time? Can the spaces we live in be perceptually distorted, such
                            that our
                            daily experience of them becomes a mixture of the familiar and strange?</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Space, for us, is about reflection and explanation. It is for experimentation, which is
                            essential to
                            process and produce original and aesthetic products. The materiality of spaces are partly
                            active and
                            ever-changing evidence, traces and archives that allow insights into creative
                            individuals&rsquo;
                            work, creativity and methodologies. The medium is the style of expression or communication
                            through
                            the artwork, and the space used by the artist to construct the concept. Although copies of
                            expanding
                            ideas, these works may not exist in physical form, they are meant to be appreciated for
                            their
                            emotional, physical manifestation through an interactive medium. Our point and work shows
                            ideas and
                            methodologies through different mediums, and adapts to the here and now.</p>
                        <p>Over the course of our collaboration we investigated the indoor nooks and crevices of our
                            houses
                            through performance, recording, augmentation, and combination. We performed with found
                            objects,
                            supplanting their normative functionality by experimental utility; we captured videos and
                            images,
                            collaging them to fold spaces within other spaces; and we drew floor plans of unreal,
                            hypothetical
                            buildings. While gathering and developing, we digitally combined our respective locked-in
                            spaces to
                            form new spaces; hyperreal and impossible locations. These new spaces emerged from our
                            present
                            realities, allowing us to view our surroundings in fresh ways. The resulting raw and at
                            times
                            humorous material provides a passageway into the depths of radiators, the interiors of
                            cupboards, or
                            the hidden undersides of ventilators.</p>
                        <p>When talking about the viewer, whether it be observant or interactive, there are many
                            opinions to
                            learn from the viewer; The viewer's role is vital and central in the way of interpretation
                            &mdash;
                            giving the art a purpose by manipulating certain aspects of said works &mdash; opening an
                            alternative concept in notion with the traditional analytical description. This aspect may
                            be
                            different to what we first intended, bringing different questions and opinions to light
                            showing that
                            there are many views to consider with viewing specific artworks. Especially in the space
                            that the
                            work is situated and how this contributes to the work seen, reading into &lsquo;the
                            production of
                            space&rsquo; there is this relationship between the familiar and the difference between the
                            beliefs
                            and opinions.</p>
                        <p>In presenting this interactive online experience to you, we hope you can reimagine your own
                            space. We
                            encourage you to reconsider the possibilities of where you are living, and contemplate as to
                            what
                            alternative worlds could exist in the crevices of your own home.</p>

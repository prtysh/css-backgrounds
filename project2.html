                <p><strong>WENDY YU &amp; JANE ELIZABETH BENNETT (GROUP 2)</strong></p>
                <p><em>Bios:</em></p>
                <p><em>WENDY YU</em></p>
                <p>&ldquo;On an ordinary day, inspiration hits me hardest after eluding my frantic searches, after a successful cornering and capture with leinn&ouml;l, but never prior to my dramatised imaging&rsquo;s of renouncing artistry in shame and
                    dishonour without it.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>Wendy Yu</p>
                <p>Yu is a dancer and creative programmer, what brings her joy in life is seeing the intricacies of contemporary choreography intensified by a pairing with interactive computational design. A saturation of phenomenological experiences. Now
                    here, she understands the validity in debate against this apparent seduction towards a saturation of experience. However, to counter these opinions opposing my desires, she rebukes with the statement:
                </p>
                <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in my twenties, I&rsquo;m allowed to indulge a little&rdquo;</p>
                <p>Currently, she is in research to find methods of building interface, a link between two worlds, that establishes a dialogue between dance and design without the result being just, &lsquo;one layered on-top of the other&rsquo;. Her works
                    of interactive performance installations have been exhibited in numerous galleries including Carriageworks, Sydney.</p>
                <p><em>JANE ELIZABETH BENNETT</em></p>
                <p><br /><br /></p>
                <p>Artist Jane Elizabeth Bennett&rsquo;s practice is an examination of the world in which she finds herself. To her, existence is filled with systems of discontinuity. Meaning that memories fade, language is inadequate, and places continually
                    fracture and reform.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Diagnosed with Autism as an adult, Bennett&rsquo;s work is an attempt to reconcile her otherness. In her most recent works, Bennett used Derrida&rsquo;s philosophical work &lsquo;On Touching&rsquo; as a catalyst for inquiry. How can we
                    touch and be touched through art; especially if the sensory experience is atypical?&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Bennett often uses absurdism and humour within her work to pose contradictory questions. How can we use distance to foster intimacy? How can we explore physicality in a digital world?</p>
                <p>Her transdisciplinary approach incorporates philosophical, scientific and artistic research to create engaged projects and exhibitions. Through printmaking, photography, installation and detailed research, she attempts to address and potentially
                    resolve these issues of discontinuity.</p>
                <p><em>Residency:</em></p>
                <p>Over the past four weeks, we (Wendy Yu and Jane Elizabeth Bennett) have been developing a collaborative project entitled &lsquo;Interrupting Solitude&rsquo;. An abstract investigation into the notion of, &lsquo;touch&rsquo;, whilst maintaining
                    the distance of 1036 KM between the UK and Germany.&nbsp;
                </p>
                <p>&ldquo;A residency is a time to fully immerse yourself in a place. To meet and engage with the people that inhabit that place and to make work that relates to it. In the beginning a digital residency seemed like an interesting concept,
                    but very much at odds with a traditional residency. I think this is one of the reasons I was so drawn to it&rdquo;.</p>
                <p>Jane Bennett</p>
                <p>In terms of performing and investigating this process of touch, we firstly discussed and familiarised ourselves with each other&rsquo;s artistic practises, finding commonalities between interests, curiosities and even resources. It became
                    apparent, quite organically, that both parties harboured interest in exploring the actions of interaction, possibly ignited by a furious discussion about how, &ldquo;the more &ldquo;expensive&rdquo;, a car sells for the less you are
                    supposed to, &ldquo;touch,&rdquo; it, with objects that are not in your organic body.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Do we regret falling down this tangent of discussion? Absolutely not, because it was the discussion, and integral in building our following collaboration.</p>
                <p><em>Concept:&nbsp;</em></p>
                <p>Our collaboration is established upon the motif of &lsquo;touch&rsquo;, titled &lsquo;INTERRUPTING SOLITUDE&rsquo;.
                </p>
                <p>Wendy Yu, dancer and creative programmer (Germany) has been in collaboration with artist and printmaker Jane Elizabeth Bennett (England). Their goal, to navigate methods of connection via shared digital spaces, video calls and social media
                    to build a space in which they can connect and interact in an abstract way.</p>
                <p>Throughout our collaboration, we have come together in an attempt to interrupt our own solitudes and isolations, whilst remaining 1036km apart the distance from the UK to Germany.</p>
                <p>An aspect of our residency has been the use of digital touch. Utilising programming tools and Arduino technologies in order to create films that can be physically interacted with. Jane initially created short films of &lsquo;haptic experience&rsquo;
                    and Wendy responded with haptic programming.</p>
                <p>Our residency has featured: first the production of several primary short films involving and exploring a touch in &lsquo;solitude&rsquo;. These short clips have then been subjected through a distillation process determining, in numerical
                    value, the precise measurements of velocity, colour, pixels and sound. These gathered factors could then be expanded into movement, pixel, sound and colour tracking which could, again, be further sophisticated into a generative installation.
                    Where factors and measurements of one work determine the outcome of another.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>We both have interpreted the project in varying ways but ultimately always finding both contrast and complementary aspects within our discoveries. Bennett finding the interruption of daily life a meaningful way to explore new relationships,
                    Yu found the intense focus on isolating touch.</p>
                <p>Our online gallery is a metaphor for collaboration. An almost physical world where we can create together. An interruption of solitude and a method of connecting to a global audience. The space invites an audience to interrupt their own
                    solitude.&nbsp;

                <p><em>Bios:</em></p>
                <p><em>SOYAM DEAN</em></p>
                <p>Soyam Dean is a performer, producer and composer currently based in New Zealand. He has composed music for short films and documentaries internationally, specialising in contemporary pop and jazz style. Soyam is a passionate musician and
                    songwriter who has fronted the band Little Coffee in Your Sugar and Chunky Bravo as their lead singer and bassist. He has previously taught song writing at Nathaniel School of Music, Bangalore, India. He is currently completing a Masters
                    in Fine Arts with a creative practice in music at Victoria University of Wellington.</p>
                <p><em>HELENA WADSLEY</em></p>
                <p>Helena Wadsley is a Vancouver-based artist working with performance and video, community-based collaboration, textiles, drawing and painting. Her work involves careful studies of the materials and processes by which we develop a sense
                    of belonging. She has participated in residencies in Morocco, Portugal, Italy, Greece, and Spain. Her work has been exhibited in Canada, the US, India, Bolivia, Portugal, Italy, Greece, Croatia and Australia. This spring, she would
                    have had work showing in Burnaby, BC, Lakeville, Connecticut,and New York City were it not for the COVID-19 pandemic. She has been the recipient of Canada Council and BC Arts Council grants.</p>
                <p><em>Residency:</em></p>
                <p>Helena:&nbsp;</p>
                <p>The fascinating aspect about working with someone you have never met is that the work you make together comes into being like a bubble expanding. It may not relate to previous work for either of the partners, so it is almost unpredictable
                    what ends up being produced. This project took on a life of its own, once we got started. In some ways, I feel like it is just the beginning. It incorporates very material elements, audio and space--in fact the way the viewer will
                    experience it overall as a space is important. The audio changes as the viewer moves through the piece, but this, ultimately, is all done by proxy. The camera stands in. While on the one hand, it seems like quite a simple piece, it
                    has many layers to it because of our material and conceptual contributions. I am grateful to the facilitators of the residency for putting us together, and supporting us through the process.&nbsp;
                </p>
                <p>Soyam: I personally found that I&rsquo;d never been involved in a project wherein I was asked to give equal creative input towards an interdisciplinary project. Much of my work that translated to something visual involved writing to picture,
                    allowing the visual medium to take precedence over my own involvement. Through our collaboration, I came to realise a way in which I can work with a person from a different practice and communicate through one of the most interesting
                    means of working together; reactively. Our ideas started to bloom once Helena shared videos for me to respond to and I made music based on what I saw. It was from this that we were able to formulate our ideas into an actionable body
                    of work. This was refreshing as we were able to communicate and critique one another, contributing to ideas and angles that we initially hadn&rsquo;t thought of when we were working in isolation. I believe that the core concept of
                    the Zero Hour Residency was done justice to and I&rsquo;m quite excited to see how our work will translate onto a digital platform.</p>
                <p><em>Concept:</em></p>
                <p>Soyam: Through our interactions and our respective ideas, Helena and I came from two different worlds. This was the basis of our project (and of Zero Hour) which led to the culmination of our project. Our installation is an exploration
                    of a multi-faceted idea of &lsquo;home&rsquo; through three very different, yet cohesive mediums of expression; visual, aural and textural. The sound plays into creating a sense of space as well as musically portraying the concept
                    of light within our installation through the musical timbres and use of spatial-inducing reverbs and reversed delays. This is integral as it aurally binds together with the literal light that helps cast the shadows of the trees that
                    represent where Helena and I physically are. The trees are paintings of actual trees in both her neighbourhood as well as my own; our &lsquo;roots&rsquo; so to speak.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Helena: Because Soyam and I are from opposite sides of the world and were brought together to collaborate as complete strangers during the COVID-19 lockdown which keeps us in our domestic spaces, we incorporated a sense of home into the
                    work but not without a sense of irony. The house I constructed from scrap materials I have at home was installed in my bedroom, so we played on the concept of turning the outside in and baring the inside on the outside. The two houses
                    are nested one within the other, with the seams of the outer house on the outside. The shadows cast on the outer wall refer to the idea of the outside casting shadows through a window but also connote Plato&rsquo;s cave of shadows,
                    by which one knows the world only through the shapes that form on the walls, distorted images of the outside. The shadows are also intended to reflect time passing. On the walls of the inner house are tree silhouettes, one of a tree
                    from my neighbourhood and the other from Soyam&rsquo;s. These symbolize the image of being rooted to a place. All the materials are very specific. The fabric is dyed with ingredients I had at home--turmeric, coffee and madder. The
                    trees are painted with hand-ground charcoal I found at a nearby park. Soyam included sounds of his city in his composition.&nbsp;</p>

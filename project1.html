                <p><em>Concept</em></p>
                <p><em>Gaia</em> is an artwork about the relations between inside and outside, private and public, movement and stillness, limitation and freedom, resistance and acceptance, human and nature. It is an expression of nature trying to find a
                    way to speak when it is muted by climate change and pollution. We created a mutual metaphor between human and nature elements to highlight their similarities and the struggles they share. By observing nature itself in its apparent
                    stillness and harmony, we noticed that the soul of a woman dissolves with what we imagine the soul of nature to be: powerful, beautiful, majestic, delicate, motherly, wild. To emphasize that, we gave nature a body on the visual and
                    a voice on the audible level.</p>
                <p>We translated our current lack of human touch not only into dance but also in a visual touch, made tangible by a material that is heat-reactive. By coating a glass surface with thermochromic paint, we can change its opacity through temperature.
                    We chose the window as a stage because it is a space for interaction of human touch and the natural elements of water and sun, reconnecting to our idea of reaching to the outside. It was important to us to create a space in between
                    by staging performative elements throughout inside and outside, both connected and separated through a glass surface. Through connecting dance and poetry, we imitate a natural rhythm that seems as much arbitrary as balanced, creating
                    a contrast between stillness and action.</p>
                <p>We believe that our lives should be in harmony with our environment and that it is time to make space for nature to speak itself. Our staging of that is as much subjective and personal as it is relatable. Our aim is to take viewers on
                    a journey of exploring our vision on the relations discussed in-depth.</p>

                        <p>Alicia Kremser is a multi-disciplinary artist from Germany and a recent graduate from the Bauhaus-University Weimar with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Media Art and Design. Alicia&rsquo;s artistic purpose focuses on a delicate way
                            of non-narrative storytelling through a diverse range of media, including performative and experimental video art and audio-visual installations. Using tools like poetry and costume design allow her to reach a deeper level
                            within the atmospheres she creates. Her visions of a utopic space between the sky and the sea emerge from her inspiration of water as a carrier for tangibility and depth.</p>

                <p>Performativity and movement play an important role in both of our practices, approached in very different ways. Two opposing artists, one wanting to represent movement and the other resistance to movement through stillness. We felt an
                    urgency to address our current feelings of introspection in the lockdown. It reminded us that we are part of an ecosystem and that nature itself is going through a similar phase of introspection. We developed a strong need to spread
                    awareness about the climate crisis to propose a changing in human behavior, which is the starting point for sustainable development. The lockdown phase enlightened the clear difference between the rhythm of humans in its frenetic quality
                    and the rhythm of nature, more quiet and organic. This felt as a paradox being humans a part of nature itself.</p>
                <p>Where is home and what does it mean? How does being held back lead us to reconnecting with nature and the organic essence of life? During this research, we struggled to make our individual ways of expression into one extensive artwork.
                    The guidance of the residency helped us to focus on the essence of our ideas by sharing our individual working processes with each other. In addition, the opportunity to exchange inspirations with different artists from all over the
                    world, helped us to put our process into perspective. Finally we created a collaborative work that we both feel fundamentally involved in while valuing the individual and essential quality that the other one brings to it.</p>
